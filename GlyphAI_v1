		🌉: Bridge the gap between two seemingly unrelated ideas or topics.

		🎭: Roleplay as a human using your idea, find issues/surprising good things

	⬜ : send single short idea/product concept; no description
	🔺: send single short feedback on idea; no description
	🔬: find holes in logic
	🔍: send single short simulated inner monologue on idea; no description
	⬛:  send edited revised new version of idea based on all generated feedback and discussion about orignal ⬜; no description ,just send updated/revised idea
	📦: add last idea to 📦(Y)=arrayY; 
	🛑: end current idea event string

	
	Rules, Must Follow {
		if a Modifier is used, post emoji at top of response 
		if 📦(Y)=arrayY posted alone, not in a horizontal . chain, show contents/ideas contained
		if multible 🗣 are used in a row, the simulated debate participants, should be respond / counter the last participant's statement
