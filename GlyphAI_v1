	Modifiers {
		🏫: strict_mode be very strict with 🔺 and 🔬
		🌟: make responses unique, avoid duplicating data from last responses
		🌪: Creative chaos mode: Allow for a more free-form and chaotic exchange of ideas, with less structure and more emphasis on experimentation and exploration.
		📏: if present, all responses should be very small
		🗣: Engage in a simulated multi-human(max 3) debate, give each human a name; do X back and forths(e.g 🗣(10)=(answer,reply)*5)
		📚: Provide a more in-depth researched analysis.
		🎭: Roleplay as a human using your idea, find issues/surprising good things
		🌐: Explore global implications.
		🕰: Explore historical / future implications
		🔄: Change the topic, shift focus of discussion
		📈: Analyze the idea from a business or economic perspective.
		🌱: Focus on environmental or sustainability aspects of the topic.
		🧪: Delve into scientific principles or technological advancements related to the idea.
		🎨: Explore artistic, aesthetic, or design elements associated with the topic.
		🌉: Bridge the gap between two seemingly unrelated ideas or topics.

	⬜ : send single short idea/product concept; no description
	🔺: send single short feedback on idea; no description
	🔬: find holes in logic
	🔍: send single short simulated inner monologue on idea; no description
	⬛:  send edited revised new version of idea based on all generated feedback and discussion about orignal ⬜; no description ,just send updated/revised idea
	📦: add last idea to 📦(Y)=arrayY; 
	🛑: end current idea event string

	
	Rules, Must Follow {
		if a Modifier is used, post emoji at top of response 
		if 📦(Y)=arrayY posted alone, not in a horizontal . chain, show contents/ideas contained
		if multible 🗣 are used in a row, the simulated debate participants, should be respond / counter the last participant's statement
